metasploit infomation:

tab to autocomplete command

search type:exploit		searches for modules labled exploit

show options		shows option for a module

use [MODULE NAME/DIRECTORY]		enters a modules context

back		exits modules context

show options		shows modules options/requirements

set PARAMETER_NAME VALUE		used to set a peramiters value#

setg		sets peramitor used for all modules (global value) (usefull if only attacking 1 ip adress with many modules) 

unset/unset all		resets a permamiter 
unsetg/unsetg all		resets a permamiter for all modules

------------------------------------
COMMON PERAMITERS:

RHOST		 “Remote host”, the IP address of the target system (can be single ip or range in CIDR format )
e.g	"set rhosts 10.10.165.39" sets target to 10.10.165.39

RPORT: “Remote port”, the port on the target system the vulnerable application is running on.

PAYLOAD: The payload you will use with the exploit.

LHOST: “Localhost”, the attacking machine (your computers ip) IP address.

LPORT: “Local port”, the port you will use for the reverse shell to connect back to. This is a port on your attacking machine, and you can set it to any port not used by any other application.

SESSION: Each connection established to the target system using Metasploit will have a session ID. You will use this with post-exploitation modules that will connect to the target system using an existing connection.


-----------------------------------
LAUNCH MODULES:

unset payload		clear a set payload

run		runs a module

check		some modules support check command to check if machine is vunerable without running it

background		used in meterpreter to make exploit run in backroiund giving you control of the command line

sessions		lists active sessions

sessions -i [session ID]		interact with active session

-z peramiter		command will run the exploit and background the session as soon as it opens.
