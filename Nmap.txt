Nmap things:
https://youtu.be/4t4kBkMsDbQ
script that does many things https://nmap.org/nsedoc/categories/vuln.html

nmap -sP NETWORK IP (e.g 192.168.1.0/24)
Scans all ips from .1.1 to .1.255 on the network				nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24

nmap -sT -p 80,443 192.168.1.1
scan ports 80(http) and 443(https) on specified IP adress		you do not need -p unless you are specifiing other things e.g port num or range
remove port num and -p to scan 1000 ports

nmap -sS -p 80,443 192.168.1.1
same as above just more stealthy and gets past firewalls better
remove port num and -p to scan 1000 ports


nmap --script vuln 192.168.1.1

TAGS:
-sn
ping sweep, sends ICMP to ips good for probing and finding out online computers

-oN [FILE PATH]			e.g -oN nmap/scan (will create scan file and write to it)
save output of scan

-v		(add up to 5 letter V)
verbose (more info i tend to use -vv or -vvv)

-sC
script scanning

-sV
version of service running on port

-A
OS detection, version detection script scanning and traceroute

-O
Scans for open ports and tries to figure out what OS they are using

-D 192.168.1.1 
uses ip adress immidiatly after as a decoy e.g  nmap -sS -D 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.60

-R
DNS search for all ips even offline ones

-n
Avoid DNS search (wont give pcs names)

Common Ports:
note: 


tcp/23 - telecommunication, login to devices remotely with consol access NON INCRIPTED hacker can listen to packets and get passwords and usernames of anyone who uses

tcp/22 - SSH (Secure Shell) exacly the same as port 23 just encripted
SFTP protocol that transfers files and data using undelying SSH protocol (encrypted)

tcp/20 (for active mode data) - FTP (File tranfer protocol) needs authentication from user, with acess can change add or delete any file on system
tcp/21 (for control) 

udp/69 - TFTP (trivial file transfer protocol) Very simple  no authentication or encryption

udp/53 - DNS, port for a server that converts URLs to ip adresses 

tcp/25 - SMTP simple mail transfer protocol

udp/67 - DHCP (Dynamic host configuration protocol) automaticaly gives pc a IP address	requires DHCP server on network (sometimes built into router) 
udp/68		addresses are assigned by a MAC adress in the DHCP server

tcp/80 - HTTP unencrypted

tcp/443 - HTTPS encrypted

udp/161 - SNMP (simple network management protocol) get data and stats from devices on network 	V3 and above is encrypted 

tcp/3389 - RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) remotely connect to a desktop and control it 

udp/123 - NTP (Network time protocol) syncs clocks over devices

tcp/5060 - SIP (Session initiation protocol) used for ringing calling and hanging up phones 
tcp/5061

tcp/1720 - VoIP (voice over IP) same as SIP just older but still used

tcp/445 - SMB (server message block) microsoft uses for file and printer info sharing
